when passing an array to a function, you are passing a pointer to that array and the pointer is size of 8 bytes

malloc calloc or realloc will take dynamic memory from the heap for usage, every alloc goes with free. can only free memory on heap

traverse through a string using for (int i=0; i<strlen(the_string); i++) OR use for (int i=0; arr[i] != '\0'; i++) OR
while (*s1) {*s1 (OPERATIONS); s1++;}


when initializing an array for example int arr[6] {0,1,2,3} and int arr2[6] = {1,2,3,4,5}. The garbage values are equal to each other when comparing

int add(int *num1, int num2) {  // this BOTH modifies the value that num1 is pointing to and returning the value that num1 is pointing to
    *num1 += num2;
    return *num1;
}

int add(int *num1, int num2) {  // this ONLY returning the value that num1 is pointing to plus num2, this does not modifies the value that num1 is pointing to
    return *num1 + num2;
}
