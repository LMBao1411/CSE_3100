when passing an array to a function, you are passing a pointer to that array and the pointer is size of 8 bytes

malloc calloc or realloc will take dynamic memory from the heap for usage, every alloc goes with free. can only free memory on heap

traverse through a string using for (int i=0; i<strlen(the_string); i++) OR use for (int i=0; arr[i] != '\0'; i++) OR
while (*s1) {*s1 (OPERATIONS); s1++;}
