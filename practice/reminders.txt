when passing an array to a function, you are passing a pointer to that array and the pointer is size of 8 bytes

malloc calloc or realloc will take dynamic memory from the heap for usage, every alloc goes with free. can only free memory on heap

traverse through a string using strlen() OR use 
while (*s1) {
    *s1 (OPERATIONS);
    s1++;
}
